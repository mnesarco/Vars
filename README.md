This Add-On provides an alternative option to raw VarSets. Here
variables are first class DocumentObjects.

## Features

1. All Variables are scoped to the document (global in the document).
2. All variables are first class DocumentObjects. This provides
   a performance gain because dependencies are decoupled eliminating
   unnecessary recomputes caused by false dependencies.
3. Out of the box renaming.
4. Custom GUI for variables management.
5. Import/Export variables support.
6. Show references inside the document.

### Added in 0.0.2
